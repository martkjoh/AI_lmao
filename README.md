A homegrown, organic and free range deep neural network, without external libraries. This is a neural network made using C++. Heavily influenced by the exelent video series by 3blue1brown.

This is a neural network made using C++. Heavily influenced by the exellent video series by [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi), 
and [this](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html) chapter from Michael Nielsen free online book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning". The maths behind a neural network is explained in the pdf [AI_lmao_math](https://github.com/martkjoh/AI_lmao/blob/7960bb23ce17de68033bfc7202bbc4199404bbc4/AI_lmao_math.pdf). 
Only standard libraries are used for the network itself, but [Magick++](http://www.imagemagick.org/Magick++/) is used to import the training images.

\section*{Data structure}
The class \codeword{Layer} contains $N$ nodes ($n$) and biases ($b$), as well as an $m \times n$ matrix ($w$).
A neural network, here represented by the class \codeword{neuralNet}, is a linked list of $l$ layers. It takes a vector \codeword{L} of length $l$ as input, where the $i$th element $L_i$, corresponds to the number of neurons in layer $i$ of the network
